After many requirements gathering and brand positioning meetings with their marketing team, we crafted a script using characters and a common scenario their target audience could relate to. ",

Audio plays a big role in any video project but to achieve the level of warmth that the client was going for, a larger emphasis was placed on sound design and voice actor selection. In the end everything came together harmoniously to created a video that really pulls at the audience’s heart strings."
